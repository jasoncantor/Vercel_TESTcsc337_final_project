# Current Progress

The project is progressing well. The backend is well-structured with models for `Budget` (`backend/models/Budget.js`), `Equipment` (`backend/models/Equipment.js`), `SpecialTask` (`backend/models/SpecialTask.js`), `Task` (`backend/models/Task.js`), and `User` (`backend/models/User.js`). Routes for handling CRUD operations are implemented for `budgets` (`backend/routes/budgets.js`), `equipment` (`backend/routes/equipment.js`), `specialTasks` (`backend/routes/specialTasks.js`), `tasks` (`backend/routes/tasks.js`), and `users` (`backend/routes/users.js`). The frontend is designed with a login screen and a dashboard with sections for job board, special tasks, budget tracker, and equipment tracker (`frontend/index.html`).

However, there are some struggles. Ensuring proper data handling and error management in the backend routes and frontend interactions has been challenging.

# Design Changes

The design has changed since the original design. New features like special task tracker and equipment tracker have been added, which were not in the original design. No features have been omitted.

# Future Plans

We plan to add more features to the project, such as a detailed reporting system for budgets and tasks, and a notification system to alert users about upcoming tasks and deadlines. We also plan to improve the user interface to make it more intuitive and user-friendly.

# Lessons Learned

During the development process, we have learned the importance of proper planning and design. We have also learned the importance of thorough testing to ensure that all features work as expected and that there are no bugs or issues. Additionally, we have learned the importance of good communication and collaboration within the team to ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals.

# User Creation Functionality

We have added the functionality to create a user on the home page. The `frontend/index.html` file now contains a user creation form with input fields for username and password. The `frontend/js/main.js` file has been updated to handle user creation by sending a POST request to the backend. The backend route for user creation in `backend/routes/users.js` has been added to support user creation and save the user to the database.
